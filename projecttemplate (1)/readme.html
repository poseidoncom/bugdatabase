This is the project template for the project work of 
Databases and Open Interfaces course.

After you have forked your copy of the project, try to compile the project immediately by issuing the following command to right hand side shell (not console tab but shell)

<pre>mvn clean compile package</pre>

as a result a compiled jar-file and resources appear to target folder.

After this you can test the template by issueing the following command to shell:

<pre>java -jar target/dbapplication-1.jar</pre>

<h3>Information</h3>

Application is using SQLLite, thus all SQL-statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE) must be defined using SQLite dialect, which is a little different than MySQL-dialect. (use existing tables as a reference).
